### 3. Introduction to Computer Systems

A computer system is a combination of hardware, software and data which are used to solve the problem of human beings.

Programs will be stored inside the RAM or memory. CPU will fetch the program from the memory and then it will execute it.

H/W -> CPU(stands for central processing unit), Memory(Harddisk, RAM(stands for random access memory), cache, register)

The difference between RAM and Hard Disk is permanent. The data which we store in hard disk is permanent, wherease RAM is not. But, RAM is more expensive and fast than Harddisk.

### 4. How hardware devices work together

This lecture describes interactions between CPU, RAM and Harddisk.


### 5. Need for Operating Systems from scratch

Among these 500 programs.. 50 program is being chosen by a functionality called as Long Term Scheduler. 

Which process should access the CPU first is called Short Term Scheduler. Out of these many processes Which process should acquire the CPU first? Is being decided by our Short term Scheduler.

The main function of operating systems is Resource allocation or Resource management. Operating Systems is a code which will have lots of functions and the main functionality of operating system is nothing but Resource allocation or Resource management.

### 6. How Input and Output devices work together

When comptuer is switched on, Operationg systems program will be loaded inside the RAM. This called 'OS code' or 'OS space', whereas the remaining space of RAM is used for placing our programs. This called 'User space'.

Operating system is nothing but, a program which is going to act as a Resource manager.

Any I/O device will have a buffer(= memory or register) associated with it(= RAM?).

Any device acts I/O device. Moniter is always Output device. Keyboard is always Input device. Hard disk is always Input & Output device as well.

Turn-around time =  Burst time(= Execution time) + I/O time + Wating time
