# Section 2. Overview and Benefits of Computer Networks

### 11. What Is a Computer Network?

A computer network in its most basic form, it's really nothing more than two computers that are connected together to allow them to share resources with one and another.

When we talk about computer networks, there are two primary aspects. There's a physical connection or a physical component(wires, cables, wireless media), and there is a logical connection or a logical component(data transporting across the physical media).


### 12. Some Basic Computer Networking Rules

Basic Networking Rule 1 : The computers in a network must use the same procedures for sending and receiving data. We call this communication protocols.

Basic Networking Rule 2 : Data must be delivered uncorrupted. If it is corrupted, it's useless. (There are Exception)

Basic Networking Rule 3 : Computers in a network must be capable of determining the origin and destination of a piece of information. i.e. its IP and Mac Address.

### 13. Types of Networks (by Size)

Personal Area Network (PAN), Local Area Network(LAN), Wirelss Local Area Network(WLAN), Camput Area Network(CAN), Metropolitan Area Network(MAN), Wide Area Network(WAN)

PAN -> Ultra-small networks used for personal use to share data from one device to another. Can be wired (PAN) or wireless(WPAN). i.e. USB, Bluetooth, NFC, ANT+.

LAN -> A computer network within a small geographical area, such as a single room, building or group of buildings. All devices are directily connected via cables and/or short-range wireless technology. **Doesn't require a leased telecommunications line from an Internet Sevice Provider(ISP).**

WLAN -> A LAN that's dependent on wireless connectivity or one that extends a traditional wired LAN to a wireless LAN.  

WAN -> A computer network that extends over a large geographical distance, typically multiple cities and countries. WANs connect geographically distant LANs. Typcially yse leased telecommunications lines from ISP. i.e. The Internet.

### 14. Peer-to-Peer vs. Client-Server Architecture

Peer-to-Peer

- All computers on the network are peers
  - **No dedicated servers**
  - **There's no centralized control** over shared resources.
- Any device can share its resources as it pleases.
- **All computers can act as either a client or a sever.**
- Easy to set-up, and **common in homes** and small businesses. 

Client-Server

- The network is composed of client and servers
  - **Servers provide resources**
  - **Clients receive resources**
- Servers provide centralized control over network resources (files, printers, etc.)
- Centralizes user accounts, security, and access controls to simplify network administration
- More difficult to setup and requires an IT administrator

### 15. Why Build a Computer Network?

Computer networks and the sharing of electronic data encourage the use of **standard policies and procedures**.
